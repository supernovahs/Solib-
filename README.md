# Solib-
Ethereum Public good solely focused on providing value for Solidity developers.

## Audit

Points below are referenced by studying [code4arena's](https://code4rena.com/) previous contest.

- Is the slippage hardcoded? 
- Are USDC, UST's value hardcoded to 1$? The protocol may not be able to liquidate their users in a  black swan event, and also allow arbitrage parallely.
- Can the Admin be changed in one transaction? There should be 2 txs , one to set new address and other for new address to claim ownership
